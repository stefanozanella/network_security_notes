# Notes on Network Security

This repository contains the source of notes taken about the Network Security
class held by prof. Nicola Laurenti at Universit√† di Padova during 2nd semester
of A.A. 2012/13.

Due to the high amount of math involved in the notes, they're written in the
superset of Markdown provided by the 
[kramdown gem](http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/).

## Source conversion
You can convert the notes to all available outputs formats by simply installing
the `kramdown` gem:

```
gem install kramdown
```
or, if you prefer, there's a `Gemfile` available:

```
bundle install
```
