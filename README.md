# Notes on Network Security

### You can browse the deployed version of this repository at [blog.dontwakethecat.net/network_security_notes]()

This repository contains the source of notes taken about the Network Security
class held by prof. Nicola Laurenti at Universit√† di Padova during 2nd semester
of A.A. 2012/13.

Due to the high amount of math involved in the notes, they're written in the
superset of Markdown provided by the 
[kramdown gem](http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/).
